This repo contains FORTH code-examples and -snippets for use with a J1 CPU. The code is compatible to SwapForth (ANS 94 FORTH) and is developed on an XILINX-FPGA (Digilent Nexys4 Board), running on a J1Sc (A J1 impl by Steffen Reith). The J1 CPU in original is from James Bowman (Link below).

WARNING: This is still work-in-progress and is not meant to be used in any other than experimental environment.
